## Opening Scene - The Suffering Human.

A beggar (a daily scene) is **sitting on a chest** begging for small change from passers-by. A passerby asked the beggar did he ever even **think to check** what is inside the chest he has been **sitting on and begging** daily.

The beggar said, "it didn't strike me ever to check what is inside, **let me do it now**!" As he opened the chest, he found it was **filled with gold coins**.

## The Learning

The story explains the lives of people who lead their life **believing in the external world** for survival without checking **what is within** (the chest they are sitting on).

Within them is the enlightening **treasure of guidance** to the true purpose of life.

As humans, we are a part of the Universal Life with an **expanding consciousness** to make ourselves and all life lively (born to win) - for all Life matters. The success story IN TWO WORDS - '**You Matter**'.

Adhering to the **inspiration the Universal Life** breathes (unfolds) in us is the PURPOSE of our life.

The solutions are within, to **all that is around us**.
